        \ multiple ways of accessing the same Application you can either:\n\n- Track\
        \ multiple independent sessions or,\n- Use the same session across all of\

        \ other state, such as the user's cart.\nIf two points of access to the application\
        \ have independent states, for example a user can have different\nitems in\
        \ their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session\
        \ ID's.\n\nSee more information and tips about session management in the [documentation](/docs/dev/concepts/entities#customer-session).\n\
        \n### Sessions and customer profiles\n\n- To link a session to a customer\
        \ profile, set the `profileId` parameter in the request body to a customer\
        \ profile's `integrationId`.\n- While you can create an anonymous session\
        \ with `profileId=\"\"`, we recommend you use a guest ID instead.\n\n**Note:**\

        \n**Important:**\n- This endpoint creates a **soft** reservation. _Any_ customer\n\
